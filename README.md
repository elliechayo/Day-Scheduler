# Day-Scheduler

## Description 

The objective of the project was to modify a starter code and to create an appliction that will allows a user to add important events for each hour of the day. The events added will be saved and help the user to manage their time effectively.

The app needs to run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.






You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.
